How to build
---

Install QtCreator and Qt5 (Qt4 might work).
Open up the .pro file in the src directory with QtCreator.
Confirm the settings and continue.
Change to Release in the bottom left menu.
Press the hammer to build or press Ctrl+B.
These instructions should work on Windows aswell, haven't tested.
